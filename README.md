# hello-distr

This is a web application to demonstrate the build, deployment and release workflow for applications in Distr.
It consists of a next.js application, a Python backend and a Postgresql database. 
The containers are deployed via docker compose behind a Caddy reverse proxy, allowing access to the frontend and the
Python API.

Feel free to fork it, tinker around a bit and find out what Distr can offer for your on premises software. 

## Tools

We make use of: 
* GitHub Actions/Workflows
* GitHub Registry (`ghcr.io`)
* [Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please-action)
* [`distr-create-version-action`](https://github.com/glasskube/distr-create-version-action)

## Repository Structure

Apart from a directory for the code, config and `Dockerfile` of each the applications' components (`backend`, `frontend`, `proxy`), 
there are the following deployment specific files/directories:

* `.github/workflows/*.yaml`: These specify the GitHub action workflows.
* `deploy/`: Contains the [production docker compose file](deploy/docker-compose.yaml) and an [environment template](deploy/env.template). 
These will be uploaded to distr using the [`distr-create-version-action`](https://github.com/glasskube/distr-create-version-action), 
as defined in the [push-distr workflow](.github/workflows/push-distr.yaml).
* `release-please-config.json`: Contains the config for the release please action.

## How it works

The GitHub workflows behave differently in different scenarios. For example, when opening a PR after or during feature development, 
we want the docker build to run, but of course the built image should not be published or released yet.

### On Pull Request

When opening a PR, the `build-*` jobs are run, i.e. each part of the application is built with docker. The corresponding
`Dockerfile`s can be found inside each components' directory.

### On Push to main

When pushing to `main`, e.g. by merging a PR, the docker images are built again.

Additionally, the `release-please` workflow is run. For that to work, the corresponding GitHub action needs permissions on the repository.
We set a GitHub secret in this repository and give it the name `RELEASE_GITHUB_TOKEN`. 

For more information about the Release Please token, please [check their docs](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please-action?tab=readme-ov-file#github-credentials).

### On Push Tag (Release)

Once there is at least one commit to `main` since the last release, Release Please will open a new PR or update its existing one.
The changeset will mostly include version changes and adding relevant information to the `CHANGELOG`.

After testing and making sure everything is ready to release, you can approve and merge the Release Please PR. This will
push a tag with the new version name to the repository.
However you can also push a tag by yourself â€“ it will also start the defined workflows. 

The `build-*` workflows are started again, however this time, as the triggering event is a tag push, they will also log in to
the GitHub registry before the build, and afterwards push the resulting images to the registry.

#### Releasing a new Distr application version 

On release, additionally, the [`push-distr`](.github/workflows/push-distr.yaml) workflow is started, 
which uploads the artifacts in `deploy/` (`docker-compose.yaml` and `env.template`)to the Distr Hub, 
and makes the new version available to you and your customers. The used version name is the pushed git Tag. 

This GitHub action needs to authenticate itself against the Distr Hub, and it needs additional information as to which application the new
version should be added to. Therefore follow these one-time setup steps: 
* Create a Distr Personal Access Token in your account, as described [here](https://distr.sh/docs/integrations/personal-access-token/). 
* Add the Distr PAT to your GitHub repo's secrets and call it `DISTR_TOKEN`. 
* Make sure to have a Distr application in place, to which the newly released version can be attached. If the application does not exist yet,
create it via the Distr Web interface, by giving it a name (like `hello-distr`) and setting the type to `docker`. 
Once created, copy the ID of the application from the web interface (click on the left-most column in the application list).
* Add the copied application ID as a variable to your GitHub repository and call it `DISTR_APPLICATION_ID`. Alternatively you can also 
directly paste it into the `push-distr.yaml` workflow file (but please never directly paste any tokens/secrets!). 

See [distr-create-version-action docs](https://github.com/glasskube/distr-create-version-action/blob/main/README.md#usage) for further information regarding
this GitHub action. 

Note that in this example repo, we set the `api-base` to `https://demo.distr.sh/api/v1`. In order to make use of this in production, 
you should remove this line to use the default Distr Hub (`app.distr.sh`) instead. 

## Common Scenarios

### Showing the build version in the frontend

We often want to display the software's own version in the user interface.

## Where to go from here




## Local Development

**Postgres**

You can install Postgres locally or use Docker to run it in a container.

```shell
docker compose up
```

To run start the backend or frontend, please consult the respective `README`s in the subdirectories.
